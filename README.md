## What does it do?
Creates a grid over the selected layer.

You can choose to create gutters or columns.

## How do I use it?
Select a layer you want to apply the grid to. When you run the plugin, you will be prompted to enter the following:

**Column amount** (Give a number of how many columns you want)

**Gutter width** (Give a number of how wide you want the gutters to be)
