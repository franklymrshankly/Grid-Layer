# Grid Layer

Create columns or gutters as layers in Sketch. Useful if you need a grid on a component level.

## What does it do?

Creates a grid over the selected layer.

You can choose to create gutters or columns.

## How do I use it?

Select a layer you want to apply the grid to. When you run the plugin, you will be prompted to enter the following:

**Gutters on the outside?** (Yes/No)

**Column amount** (Give a number of how many columns you want)

**Gutter width** (Give a number of how wide you want the gutters to be)

You can also choose to create columns rather than gutters from the window menu:
